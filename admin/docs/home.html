<div style="width:100%;">
<div style="width:55%; float:left;">
<p>The WP-TrueCache purpose is to provide high availability performance in a wordpress cluster environment for the universal resource locator, www.forexlive.com. This performance includes the proper implementation of Memcache distributed caching and to maintain compatibility with existing and future plug in adaptations.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>This list is not exhaustive, for known problems that were discovered during the development of WPTRUECACHE-HA.</p>
<ol>
<li>The wordpress core function wp_list_pages breaks on PHP version 5.3.8 when the core is below level 3.2.1. The current version of PHP being used (2011-11-25) is 5.2.17. If PHP is upgraded to the current version, wordpress must also be updated as well.</li>
<li>Some browsers may not support the extra page compression and you will receive a content encoding error page. If this happens, disable the extra page compression.</li>

<h2>Adding Plug-ins</h2>
<p>Not all plug-ins are created equal and not all plug-ins are compatible with each other. The example being with the HyperDB and DBCache, where each plug-in had their own custom db.php file which is an override of the wordpress database object, wpdb. Each drop in had it own unique functionality where as one plug-in became active the other plug-in lost it functionality even though it was still reported as active.</p>
<p>Future additions of plug-ins must be careful and diligent to ensure compatibility with the existing plug-ins. Recommendations is to assigned a single point of entry that is responsible for verifying the coexistence of future plug-ins. This should be separate from the person assigned to perform the actual installation of the plug-in.</p>
